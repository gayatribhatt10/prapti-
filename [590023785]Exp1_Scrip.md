## Procedure & Observations

# Part 1: Activating WSL and Virtualization Features in Windows

## Step 1: Turn on `WSL` and `Virtualization`

* **Launch Powershell with admin privileges**: Press `win+x` and pick `"Windows Powershell (Admin)"` or `"Terminal (Admin)"`.

* Execute the WSL setup commands:
```
wsl -l -o
```
```
wsl --install Ubuntu
```

* After the WSL distribution finishes installing, it will appear among the choices.

* Once installation is complete, reboot your computer when prompted.

# The single command above accomplishes these tasks:
* Activates both "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Windows Subsystem for Linux" Windows options.
* Downloads and installs the most recent Ubuntu distribution by default.
* Prompts you to restart your computer.

## Step 2: Configure Your Ubuntu Installation

* After reboot, an Ubuntu terminal window should pop up; if not, search for and open "Ubuntu" from the Windows Start menu.

* Wait for the process to finish. You’ll be asked to set up a `UNIX username` and a password, which is distinct from your Windows credentials.

## Step 3: Turn On Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

1. To verify if virtualization is enabled:
    * Use `ctrl + shift + esc` to open Task Manager.
    * Head to the "Performance" tab.
    * Check the bottom-right for the "Virtualization" entry; it should read **Enabled**.

2. If it’s not enabled:
    * Restart your computer and access BIOS/UEFI setup (commonly with `Delete`, `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, or `Esc` at boot).
    * Navigate to the corresponding menu for Virtualization settings.
    * For Intel machines it's usually "**Intel Virtualization Technology**" or "VT-x".
    * For AMD systems, look for "**AMD-V**".
    * Switch the setting to enabled, save your changes, and exit. Your PC will restart.

* When virtualization is active, Windows should enable the **Hypervisor**. WSL will be ready to use.

* To confirm WSL functionality:
    * Open Powershell or Command Prompt and enter:
        ```wsl -l -v```
    * Your installed distros should be displayed along with their version information.

# Part 2: Setting Up VirtualBox

## Step 1: Download and Install VirtualBox

* Navigate to the [VirtualBox official downloads page.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Under "VirtualBox platform packages," select "Windows hosts" to download the setup file.
* Run the `.exe` installer.
* Continue through the setup wizard, accepting the default choices. Installing all features is recommended.
* You might receive a prompt about new device software; click "Install" to proceed.

## Step 2: (Optional) Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

*   Some systems need this for VirtualBox to work smoothly, especially when errors arise.
*   Get the latest Visual Studio 2019 Redistributable from [Microsoft's site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
*   Download and execute the **`vc_redist.x64.exe`** file.
*   Follow the instructions for installation. A reboot is suggested after completion.

    * Click **Next**.

4. Allocate System Resources:
    * Set Memory (RAM) to at least 4096 MB (minimum), provided you have 8GB or more system RAM.
    * Assign 2 or more CPUs for systems with multi-core processors.
    * Click **Next**.

5. Virtual Hard Disk:
    * Select "Create a virtual hard disk now," then press **Create**.
    * Choose the format: **VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)**.
    * For physical storage: pick "Dynamically allocated" to save space.
    * Leave file location as default or select your own. Allocate at least 25 GB disk size. Click **Create**.

## Step 3: Install Your Chosen Linux Distro

1. Select the new VM in VirtualBox and click "Start."
2. The machine will boot from the ISO file into a live session of the Linux distro.
3.   On the desktop, double-click "Install Linux" to begin.
4.   Continue through the installation steps:
    *   Pick your language and keyboard setup.
    *   Connect to WiFi if needed.
    *   When prompted, choose the default **"Erase disk and install Linux"**. *Only the VM’s virtual drive is affected.*
    *   Set your timezone.
    *   Create a user profile (name, computer/hostname, username, password).
5.   The installer will run and, upon completion, prompt you to restart.
6.   When told to "remove the installation medium," press `Enter`. VirtualBox automatically removes the ISO.
7.   The machine will reboot into your new, working Linux environment.
